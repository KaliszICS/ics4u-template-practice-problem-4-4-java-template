# Instructions  

Create a Utility class called _CampbellClass_

Inside the class should be the following methods:

  **convertString** - Can take in int, double, char or boolean and returns a string version of each one.
  **convertInchesToCenti** - Can take int or double of inches and return the converted amount in centimeters.
  **removeNonAlpha** - Takes in a string and removes all non-letter characters.  Can also take a boolean as a parameter that when true returns all letters as uppercase, when false, all lowercase.
